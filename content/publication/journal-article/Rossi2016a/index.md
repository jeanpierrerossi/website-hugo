abstract: Various species of forest trees are commonly used for ornamental purposes and are therefore frequently found in nonforest ecosystems. They constitute an important component of the so-called trees outside forests (TOF). Not much is known, however, about the drivers of TOF spatial distribution either in urbanized or in agricultural landscapes since they are generally absent from forest inventories. The present study focused on the spatial distribution of TOF across agricultural landscapes and their potential role in the dispersal of a forest pest insect, the pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pityocampa (PPM). All the TOF belonging to the genera Pinus, Cedrus and Pseudotsuga were considered as potential hosts and inventoried within a 22 x 22 km study window. We fitted a nonstationary Poisson process to the empirical data and found that ornamental TOF distribution was largely driven by the presence of buildings. Both empirical and simulated data indicated that TOF associated to human artifacts/urbanized areas  constituted the main source of landscape connectivity for the PPM in the open fields under study. Because they do not account for TOF, forest inventories dramatically underestimate landscape connectivity and provide an erroneous picture of the PPM habitat distribution. We conclude that TOF, especially the ornamental component, must be taken into account when it comes to understanding forest insect landscape dynamics or genetics. The omnipresence of TOF also suggests a potentially huge role in pest dispersal and invasive species expansion.

summary: Thaumetopoea pityocampa, la processionnaire du pin est en expansion vers le nord de l’Europe à la faveur du réchauffement climatique. Dans cette étude, nous montrons comment les arbres hors forêt hôtes de cet insectes constituent des éléments de continuité des paysages permettant l’expansion du papillon y compris à travers de très larges zones agricoles (donc sans couvert forestier) tels que la Beauce en France.
